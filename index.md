## Welcome to Rose's Project 4!
In this project I created a REST API that involves a "data" source of questions and answers.



### Importing Data
We were given a starter code to use for p4-data.js. After this, I created a file called p4-module.js that imported the data file previously created. Within the p4-module.js file, I created 6 different functions
: getQuestions, getAnswers, getQuestionsAnswers, getQuestion, getAnswer, getQuestionAnswer.
